<p><strong>FROM A CREDENTIALING AGENT FOR AN ANESTHESIA PRACTICE GROUP: "MR. JOHN DOE CLAIMS THAT HE IS NOT CERTIFIED BY NCCAA BECAUSE HE WAS 'GRANDFATHERED IN.' CAN YOU HELP WITH THIS?"</strong></p>

<p>NCCAA provides the certification process for anesthesiologist assistants in the United States. The first Certifying Examination was administered in 1992 and has been offered annually thereafter. There has never been a "grandfather period" for certification. The only way an anesthesiologist assistant can become certified is by successfully completing a Certifying Examination.</p>

                            <div style="height:30px"></div>

<p><strong>FROM AN AA PRACTITIONER: "I SENT IN MY CME DOCUMENTS IN MAY AND THEN WAS CHOSEN FOR THE CME AUDIT IN JUNE. WHY COULDN'T NCCAA USE THE EARLIER CME SUBMISSION FOR MY AUDIT?"</strong></p>

<p>In fact, NCCAA no longer requires you to submit documents with your CME submission and does not retain those documents if they are submitted. Each practitioner must submit copies of original documents for the CME audit. Be sure to retain the originals for your records.</p>

                            <div style="height:30px"></div>

<p><strong>FROM AN AA PRACTITIONER: "I WISH NCCAA WOULD NOTIFY ME WHEN MY CMES ARE DUE."</strong></p>

<p>A reminder email will be sent automatically 60, 30 and on the due date - June 1st - to the email address we have on file. Please make sure to always keep a current email on file with NCCAA so that you can get reminders for both CME and the CDQ exam.</p>

                            <div style="height:30px"></div>

<p><strong>FROM THE BUSINESS OFFICE: "WHAT IS THE SINGLE MOST TROUBLESOME ASPECT OF COMMUNICATING WITH AA PRACTITIONERS?"</strong></p>

<p>Failure to notify NCCAA of a change of address or change of name causes the most clerical headaches. Please remember to inform NCCAA of these changes.</p>

<p>This is especially problematic for Certifying Examination candidates who may be away from their home mailing address for extended rotations at other sites. It is imperative that you have your mail forwarded or picked up and handled by a delegated person if you are away, so that NCCAA can inform you of the date and mechanism for exam registration and to notify you in case your application is incomplete in any way.</p>
